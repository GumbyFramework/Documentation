### Modular Scale
Modular scale is a new ideology that we've adopted for Gumby v2. Short and sweet, it determines typographic rhythm with ratios and math. But don't be afraid. Sass handles all the math for you. Read more about the thought behind modular scale on [AListApart](http://alistapart.com/article/more-meaningful-typography). 

By default, Gumby uses the golden ratio. A great tool to use for this is the [modular-scale](http://modularscale.com/) site itself. Here are [Gumby's defaults](http://modularscale.com/scale/?px1=16&px2=78&ra1=1.618&ra2=0) for reference. From those two numbers modular scale determines the font sizes of all heading elements. As a designer you should use this scale for many reasons. Two of them being that it establishes a harmonic balance between your type sizes and because all the data will already be included in Gumby when you or the developers start to write the CSS for the pages. As long as the same numbers are used, what you see on the PSD will reflect on the developed page.
