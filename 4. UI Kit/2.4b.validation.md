### Validation
For true validation, you'll need to consult the [Javascript docs](docs link) to get set up with form validation. However, if you just want to style your fields, you're in the right place.

All you need to do is add a `success`, `warning`, `danger` or similar class to the parent of the input element to have it receive that styling. 

For example:

```
  <ul>
    <li class="field success">
      <input class="input" type="text" placeholder="Text input" />
    </li>
    <li class="field warning">
      <input class="input" type="email" placeholder="Email input" />
    </li>
    <li class="field danger">
      <input class="input" type="password" placeholder="Password input" />
    </li>
  </ul>
```

Remember though, validation needs to be set up with Javascript in order for it to actually "validate" user input. Read up more about that over in the [Validation docs](docs!!!).
