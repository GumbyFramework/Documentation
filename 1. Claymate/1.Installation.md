## Getting Claymate

Claymate exists as an [npm](https://npmjs.org/) module, so we can easily use that to install it. We reccomend you install Claymate globally to save the trouble of specifying the path to Claymate every time you invoke it.

	$ npm install claymate

Sudo is only required in cases where the shared node_modules directory for your system is owned by root. You'll notice when it throws a whole bunch of gobbledy-gook at you with stuff like ENOACCESS and complaints about permissions. A better approach to solving the problem than sudo'ing everything would be to set your npm prefix to a directory you own in $HOME, then adding that to your $PATH.
