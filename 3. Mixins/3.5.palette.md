## Palette Mixin

Quickly compose an element which matches your color palette. The palette mixin. It accepts two arguments, `$shade` which creates the background color properties of the elements, and `$palette-text-color` which is optional and defines the text color of the element. If `$palette-text-color` is not defined then the text color is determined based on its `$shade`.

```
  // $shade accepts all Gumby color palette strings
  // in addition to custom hex colors and color variables.

  @include palette($shade, $palette-text-color);
```
