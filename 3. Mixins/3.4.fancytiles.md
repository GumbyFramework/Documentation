## Fancy Tiles

Easily create grided layouts that respond gracefully. Fancy Tiles shift the number of columns in a grid at predefined breakpoints. The mixin accepts 3 values, the first is the number of columns to display an element at desktop resolution, the second is tablet, and the third value is mobile.

```
// This will create a product grid that is 
// 4 columns on desktop, 2 on tablets, and
// 1 column on mobile devices.
 
#my-product-grid-container li.product {
  @include fancytiles(4,2,1);
  min-height: 300px;
  height: auto;
}
```
