## Responsivity

The responsivity mixing that comes with Gumby is perfect for those times where you wish you hide things from certain screen sizes. In a nutshell, adding this mixin allows you to control visibility of an item depending on screen size.

Here's a quick example:

```
.dont-show-me-on-phones{
	@ include hidden($portrait-tablets);
   @ include visible($tablets);
}
```
The element with the class "dont-show-me-on-phones" will be hidden on portrait oriented tablets, but visible on landscape.

```
.all-phones{
   @include visible($all-phones);
}
```
---

You could also use this mixin to create your own show and hide classes.

```
.hide-tablet{
	@include hidden($tablets);
}
```
Then applying this class to elements in your pages will have them hidden when browsing on a tablet device.
