## Ems Mixin

The ems mixin converts pixels to ems.

For a relational value (em), the input (px value) is calculated against the value of its context. The default context is 16px. You can change the context by passing an optional second value into the mixin.

```
	.mycooldiv {
		width: em(300px);
		font-size: em(14, 21);
	}
```

##### Outputs
```
	.mycooldiv {
		width: 18.75em;
		font-size: 0.66667em;
	}
```
