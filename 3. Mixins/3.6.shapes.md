## Shapes Mixin

Use the shapes mixin to quickly shape an element. The `$shape` argument accepts `square`, `oval`, `circle`, `pill-left`, and `pill-right` values. You can also use the optional `$shape-radius` argument to use the shapes mixin to define a custom border radius.

```
@include shape($shape, $shape-radius);
```
