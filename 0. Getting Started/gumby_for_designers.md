##Gumby For Designers

###The Grid
If you're familiar with the grid you can skip this next section. If not, welcome to the world of gridded web design. It's something you'll have to get your head wrapped around but it's worth it to know and use.

Gumby uses a 940px wide grid by default that contains 12 columns that are all an equal percentage wide. Each column also has a gutter that spaces it out from the other columns. There's a bit of math that goes into it all but as a designer all you need to know is the column width, total width and the gutter size. Gumby resizes columns and handles a lot of the responsivity on its own.

We've created a few documents for your design pleasure. First is the standard 12 grid PSD that is a blank canvas to design on. (Yes it's supposed to be blank). Similarly, we supply a 16 column grid PSD for those of you who prefer a 16 column grid.  We also have a UI kit that you can use as a starting point for all your designs or just borrow some UI elements and style them in your own way.
