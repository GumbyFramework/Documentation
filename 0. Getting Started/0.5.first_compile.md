## Compiling Gumby for the First Time
Now that you have a proper home environment for Gumby and your creations to blossom, let's compile the Sass out. We recommend that you utilize an [external scss file](#partials) to add your Sass to and not edit the gumby.css file.

You'll want to move into your working directory. Let's assume we're working out of the directory `/project`

Our project folders include a `public_html` folder inside it. That's where Gumby should live. You should be in `/project/public_html/` now. Here's where the magic of Compass and Sass happens: Run `compass compile`.

Boom. If there was a change in the SCSS, the is CSS compiled out to the `/css` directory. Wasn't that easy?

But wait, there's more! If you type `compass watch` into the terminal in the next 10 minutes, Compass will watch your Sass files for any changes and automagically compile your Sass out to CSS. There really isn't a time limit on this deal but with the `compass watch` command running, you're free to edit your SCSS and have it compiled as soon as you save.
