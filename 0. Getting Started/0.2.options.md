## [Some Options with Gumby](id:options)
You have several options when working with Gumby. We'll walk you through how we would use it but this isn't a definitive guide on how fit Gumby into your workflow.

### GUI's
There are several GUI's out there that take the fear/mystery/fun out of using the terminal. Some of these include, Scout App(Cross Platform), Codekit(OSX), and Compass.app.

### Vanilla CSS
You don't need to use Sass[^1] if you're all about retro things and living in the past. The world needs historians after all! But you're free to use Gumby as an add-on to your project. Link it in and off you go! You can even customize Gumby to only include the grid or typography if that's what you need. Gumby is as flexible as you need it to be.

### Terminal (It's not scary!)
The preferred option around these parts is to use the terminal and compile our CSS that way. It can be much easier than most people think and with a few basic commands, you can be right at home in the terminal. The cornerstones of our workflow on the terminal are [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) and [Claymate]().
