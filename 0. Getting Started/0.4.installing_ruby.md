## Installing Ruby
While it's [not entirely necessary](#options) to have Ruby and use Sass with Gumby, it is highly suggested. Sass has become an invaluable tool to not only us, but many other developers all over the world. Don't take our word for it though. Check out the [Sass website](http://sass-lang.com/) to learn more.

Anyways, assuming you're still with us you'll need to install Ruby. I'll break the next section up by operating systems for ease of use. If you have Ruby >1.8.7 installed already, go ahead and skip to the next steps of [installing the gems](#gems).

### Mac
Using [Brew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/)[^2] or your package manager of choice, install RVM, Ruby Version Manager.

```
# install with brew package manager
$ brew install rvm
# or install with Ruby
$ \curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
```

Then go into terminal and run `ruby -v`. If it returns something along the lines of `ruby 1.9.2p312 (2012-01-16 revision 34318) [x86_64-darwin11.2.0]` you're in the clear! Anything greater than 1.8.7 is ideal. One last step is to run: `rvm use <version> --default`
to ensure that your gems and Ruby version will be the same every time.

You can also utilize a tool called [Jewelery Box](http://jewelrybox.unfiniti.com/). Though it requires you be on 10.7+. And be using 

**Make sure you input the proper version you installed in <version> above.**

### PC
We recommend heading over to [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/)'s website to get Ruby setup on your machine. Download an installer and run it. That's it! To double check that everything is all set up, open up Command Prompt and run `ruby -v`. If it returns something along the lines of `ruby 1.9.2p312` you're set!

### Linux
For you Linux folk, there's a few options here. You can use [RVM](https://rvm.io/), apt-get or just build it from source. Because, you know, you can do those things. In terminal run: `$ \curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable`. This will download, build, and install the latest Ruby version for your machine. Then run: `ruby -v`. If it returns something along the lines of `ruby 1.9.2p312 (2012-01-16 revision 34318)` you're good! Anything greater than 1.8.7 ideal. One last step is to run:`rvm use <version>; --default`to ensure that your gems and Ruby version will be the same every time.

**Make sure you input the proper version you installed in `<version>` above.**
