## [Installing Gem Dependencies](id:gems)
Gumby relies on some friends to make the magic happen. Gumby utilizes modular-scale, Compass and Sass specifically. You can read up on them if you would like. I'll wait here.

To install these gems you'll need to run:
`$ gem install compass modular-scale sass`

Let that do it's thing and you should be all set.
