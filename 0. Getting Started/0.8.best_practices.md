## Best Practices

Here are some tips that we've compiled while using our own framework and listening to other users.

### [Learn, Love, Live Sass](id:sass)

We can't stress enough how awesome Sass really is. It speeds up our workflow, makes updating things like colors super simple, and so many other things. If you aren't 100% comfortable with it, read the [tutorial](http://sass-lang.com/tutorial.html), everything on [The Sass Way](http://thesassway.com/), and [Sass Official Docs](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html). Sass has proved extremely valuable to our team and we're sure it'll be a perfect fit for yours.

### Use the provided _custom.scss partial

Gumby allows you to build right into the framework with the custom partial. We recommend you utilize this function.

### Don't change the gumby.css on your own

While it's [not required](#options), it is always suggested that you use the _custom.scss partial included with the framework. You can always make more and have them included in the gumby.scss file.

### Keep it DRY

You can still take your laptop whitewater rafting, but we suggest following the DRY principle of Don't Repeat Yourself. Creating mixins and using variables to simplify your CSS is definitely something you should practice. But at the same time, don't abuse Sass' functionality. There's a healthy balance you should try to achieve.

### Modular Javascript

We think you should seriously think about using a module system for your javascript like [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), a framework like [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), or for less intense applications write your javascript as [add-ons]() for Gumby. Clearly separating your javascript into units of functionality will help with maintainability and, maybe later down the road, testability. If you make an add-on, make sure to share it with the rest of us!

### Bower

We introduced compatibility with [Bower](http://bower.io/) in Gumby v2 to make your life and lives of developers everywhere simpler. Bower is a dependency manager (like gem, npm and composer) that allows you stay up to date with frameworks and the like. Running `bower update gumby` while in the folder where bower.json is will pull in the latest Gumby files from Github.

### Claymate

To help you set up your first project with Gumby, we made a neat [npm](http://npmjs.org) module called Claymate. This module allows you to install Gumby with Bower and get all of the essential files copied from Gumby to your project in one go. It also will help you to concatenate and minify your javascript using [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2). Read more about it over at the [Claymate docs]().

### Stay active in our community!

Our [Google+ community](https://plus.google.com/communities/108760896951473344451) has grown to be pretty big. There you can get quick help for all things Gumby, often from the developers themselves.

### Add Features to Gumby

Want to really make your parents proud? If in the course of your project, you create a really cool add-on for Gumby, send us a pull request. We'd love to add your work to our framework. Who knows, maybe we'll print it out and put it on our fridge!
