## Buttons
Gumby 2's UI Kit has been completely rearchitected â€” no element has received a bigger facelift and more features than our buttons. Buttons have been completely reimagined from the ground up to allow you even more flexibility than ever before as well as improved mobile performance seamlessly switching from `click` to `tap` events.

There are tons of new classes at your disposal to change the button colors, properties, and even add icons to the left or right of the buttons.

There are still styles for the entire hierarchy of buttons that your project could need, and then some, but now there's more than ever before! You can now define your button size, color, ui, add or remove rounded corners, and even apply some pretty icons thanks to `::before` and `::after` pseudo elements! Simply add the class for the desired function of the button:

```
  <div class="medium primary btn"><a href="#">Primary</a></div>
  <div class="medium secondary btn"><a href="#">Secondary</a></div>
  <div class="medium default btn"><a href="#">Default</a></div>
  <div class="medium info btn"><a href="#">Info</a></div>
  <div class="medium danger btn"><a href="#">Danger</a></div>
  <div class="medium warning btn"><a href="#">Warning</a></div>
  <div class="medium success btn"><a href="#">Success</a></div>
  <div class="medium info btn icon-left entypo icon-mail"><a href="#">Icon Left</a></div>
  <div class="medium default btn icon-right entypo icon-camera"><a href="#">Icon Right</a></div>
  <div class="medium default btn"><input type="submit" value="Submit" /></div>
  <div class="medium info btn"><button>Button</button></div>
```
