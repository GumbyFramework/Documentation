## Two Design Styles
Metro style and semi-flat design are all the rage nowadays. Gumby 2â€™s new, rearchitected UI kit embraces the latest design trends and allows you to pick and choose, or even mix flat design with more graduated design styles. There are built in classes for mixing and matching the two Gumby Framework UI flavors. Using the `.metro` class gets you flat design, while `.pretty` will get you some pretty gradients. Mix, match, and define your design language.

### Attributes
Many of the UI modules in the Gumby UI kit support a number of optional attributes that can be used to customize the modules functionality. In all instances you have the choice of using a `data-` prefix, a `gumby-` prefix or no prefix at all. Gumby supports all three of these options so take your pick!
