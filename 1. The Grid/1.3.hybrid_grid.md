## Hybrid Grid
Here is where the Gumby Framework gets way more interesting... The Hybrid Grid. What the Hybrid Grid allows you, and your designers, to do is create layouts like never before by allowing you to define what grid to use, wherever you want on the page. By defining `class="sixteen colgrid"` on any element that has been assigned a row class, or simply right on the html element you are creating a sixteen column grid within that element, or page.

The example below shows a 14-Column grid with a 16-Column grid injected in the middle of it. This will not only allow some pages of your project to be laid out using a 16-Column grid, but also any section of the page as well! You will be able to be more flexible than ever before, and your designers will have the freedom to design things that would normally "break the grid" if you were stuck with only one grid system on a page.

Again, thanks to Sass, the hybrid grid column number is a variable so go with whatever you want!

```
  <div class="row">
    <div class="fourteen columns">
      <p>14 columns</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="twelve colgrid">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="four columns">
        <p>4 columns</p>
      </div>
      <div class="four columns">
        <p>4 columns</p>
      </div>
      <div class="four columns">
        <p>4 columns</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
```
