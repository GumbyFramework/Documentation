## Hybrid Grid
The Hybrid Grid allows you to create mixed-grid layouts. By defining `class="sixteen colgrid"` on any element that has been assigned a row class, or the html element, you are creating a sixteen column grid within that element, or page.

The example below shows a 14-Column grid with a 12-Column grid injected in the middle of it. With they hybrid grid, some pages or sections of your project can be laid out using an entirely different grid configuration than the rest of it.

You can edit the grid configuration of the hybrid grid by changing the `$hybrid` variable within `var/_settings.scss`.

```
  <div class="row">
    <div class="fourteen columns">
      <p>14 columns</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="twelve colgrid">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="four columns">
        <p>4 columns</p>
      </div>
      <div class="four columns">
        <p>4 columns</p>
      </div>
      <div class="four columns">
        <p>4 columns</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
```
