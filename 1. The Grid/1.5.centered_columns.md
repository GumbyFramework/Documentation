## Centered Columns
Centered columns are placed in the middle of the row. This does not center their content, but centers the grid element itself. This is a convenient way to make sure a block is centered, even if you change the number of columns it contains. **Note: There cannot be any other column blocks in the row for this to work.**

###### HTML

```
  <div class="row">
    <div class="centered ten columns">
      <p>10 columns</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="centered six columns">
      <p>6 columns</p>
    </div>
  </div>
```
