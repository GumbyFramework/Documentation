## Tiles
Tiles are an awesome new way to lay out elements on a page that you want to maintain their â€œgrid" style layout. This allows you to preserve the look and feel of things like a grid of profile images in a friends list, or other block-style content generated by your application across devices. Tiles are invoked using the .tiles class in association with a `.two_up`, `.three_up`, `.four_up`, or `.five_up` class to determine the layout. Tiles are a fantastic addition to Gumby 2 that will help sure up some of those use cases that required you to write your own styles in earlier versions.

With Tiles maintaining their N-up configuration on mobile devices, Gumby 2 has unlocked powers never before possible in our framework before.

```
  <ul class="two_up tiles">
    <li>Two Up</li>
    <li>Two Up</li>
  </ul>
  <ul class="four_up tiles">
    <li>Four Up</li>
    <li>Four Up</li>
    <li>Four Up</li>
    <li>Four Up</li>
  </ul>
```
