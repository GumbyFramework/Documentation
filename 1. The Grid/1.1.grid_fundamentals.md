## Grid Fundamentals
Gumby Framework uses a container class to create a base padding. We also use row classes to create horizontal rows, define the page's max-width, and contain the various page columns. Column classes round out the bunch and create the final structure of the page. The magic of responsivity occurs because columns don't have a fixed width: they can vary based on the resolution of the screen, or the size of the window (try scaling down this window to see what we mean). This allows for your project to adapt to any viewport, any device, without separate stylesheets or html templates.
