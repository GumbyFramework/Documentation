## Grid Fundamentals
The core structure of the grid is defined by the use row classes to create horizontal rows which also assign the page's max-width, and function to contain the various page columns. Column classes create the final structure of the page. As a responsive, fluid-fixed, framework - our columns don't have a fixed width: they vary based on the resolution of the screen, or the size of the window (try scaling down this window to see what we mean). This allows for your project to adapt to any viewport, any device, without separate stylesheets or html templates.
