## Pushing Columns
Push columns allow you to create additional space between columns in a row. Say you have a chunk of text, lets call it a blog post, that only needs to occupy six columns; and your sidebar is only three columns wide, but it hugs the right side of the document in your comp because your designer likes tons of pretty whitespace... You can push that sidebar over to the right using `.push_three`, then profit from Gumbyâ€™s awesomeness and ease-of-use. Push columns are also nestable, just like the rest of the grid.

```
  <div class="row">
    <div class="seven columns">
      <p>7 columns</p>
    </div>
    <div class="push_one six columns">
      <p>6 columns</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="three columns">
      <p>3 columns</p>
    </div>
    <div class="push_two nine columns">
      <p>9 columns</p>
    </div>
  </div>
```
