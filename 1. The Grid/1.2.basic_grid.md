## Basic Grid
If you look at the example below you can see how the rows and columns come together to build structure. Each row of columns are inside of a div that has been assigned the row class. Thanks to Sass, all aspects of the grid are now variables that you can customize and build-to-order unique grid sizes, columnm numbers, widths and variations on each of your projects!

```
  <div class="row">
    <div class="fourteen columns">
      <p>14 columns</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="twelve columns">
      <p>12 columns</p>
    </div>
    <div class="two columns">
      <p>2</p>
    </div>
  </div>
```
