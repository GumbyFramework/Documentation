##Fixed Positions
Elements using the fixed attribute will emit onFixed and onUnfixed events as they gain and lose their fixed positions. This can be useful for modifying styles when fixed positions are added and no doubt alter your perfect layouts. If you specify an unfix point, the onUnfixed event will pass the callback an integer to specify the reason for the event. 0 for scrolling up past the first fixed point and 1 for scrolling down past the unfix point.

 View your browsers console, you should see a log each time the sidebar is fixed and unfixed.

```
  // listen for radio button checked event
  $('#my-element').on('gumby.onFixed', function() {
      console.log('Element fixed');
  }).on('gumby.onUnfixed', function(e, point) {
      if(point === 0) {
        console.log('Unfixed. Scrolled up past fix point');
      } else if(point === 1) {
        console.log('Unfixed. Scrolled down past unfix point');
      }
  });
 
  // initialize dynamically generated fixed elements
  Gumby.initialize('fixed');
```
