##Gumby Helpers
Gumby 2 JavaScript also provides several helper functions and debugging tools, all of which are housed within the global Gumby object.

`Gumby.ready()`

Similar to the well known jQuery.ready method, Gumby.ready accepts a callback function and waits until the document and all Gumby UI modules have fully loaded before running.

`Gumby.touch()`

This method is identical to Gumby.ready(), however the callback function is only run on touch enabled devices.

`Gumby.oldie()`

This method is identical to Gumby.ready(), however the callback function is only run on Internet Explorer <= version 8.

`Gumby.debug()`

This method returns an object containing an array of UI module information, useful for examining available events, as well as the oldie and $dom properties.

`Gumby.$dom`

The $dom property holds a cache of the document upon load. If you need the document in itâ€™s original state.

`Gumby.click`

The click property will be set to 'tap' where touch events are supported otherwise falling back to 'click'. Use it in your click event handlers.

`Gumby.isOldie`

A boolean to indicate if the current client is Internet Explorer <= version 8. This saves you having to query the html class attribute.

```
	Gumby.ready(function() {
    // do something when Gumby and all UI modules are ready
  });
  
  Gumby.oldie(function() {
    // do something when the document is ready on .oldie browsers
  });
 
  // if .oldie browser, let them know!
  if(Gumby.isOldie) {
    alert("Why you use oldie browser?!!");
  }
 
  // log Gumby debug object to console
  console.log(Gumby.debug());
 
  // log document cache
  console.log(Gumby.$dom);
  
  // bind to the tap event where supported with a click fallback
  $('#button').on(Gumby.click, function() {
      var ev = Gumby.click === 'tap' ? 'tapped' : 'clicked';
      alert('You '+ev+' me!');
  });
```
