##Touch Events
To improve performance on mobile devices we have a nifty little solution for handling click/tap events. In gumby.init.js we use Modernizr.load to test for touch support, if found a customized build of jQuery Mobile is loaded which includes only the touch events and minified is a grand total of 6KB. Once this file has loaded we update the Gumby.click property from 'click' to 'click tap'. The UI modules that bind to click events use the Gumby.click property instead of simply specifying 'click', ensuring e.stopImmediatePropogation is called to prevent both events from firing. This way touch enabled devices will use jQuery Mobile's tap event and receive a serious performance gain.

```
  // bind to the tap event where supported with a click fallback
 $('#button').on(Gumby.click, function(e) {
     e.stopImmediatePropagation();
     alert('You '+e.type+'ed me!');
 });
```
