##Toggles & Switches
Toggles and Switches are handled by the same UI module and they both provide two events for extending functionality. The onTrigger event is emitted when a Toggle or Switch is triggered by a user, this interaction can change depending on the event defined in the gumby-on attribute. The trigger event can also be used to programatically trigger Toggles and Switches.

```
  // listen to a toggle and switch onComplete event
  $('#toggle,#switch').on('gumby.onTrigger', function() {
      console.log('Toggle triggered');
  });
 
  // trigger a toggle and switch
  $('#toggle,#switch').trigger('gumby.trigger');
 
  // initialize dynamically generated toggles/switches
  Gumby.initialize('toggles');
  Gumby.initialize('switches');
```
