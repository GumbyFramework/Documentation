##Overview
Gumby 2 JavaScript is designed to work in the background, bringing the UI kit to life automatically, without the need to write any extra JavaScript. Gumby broadcasts and listens for specific events that can be used to extend the default behaviour of UI modules. All custom events are namespaced with 'gumby' and jQuery's on() and trigger() methods make binding and triggering these events easy.

To improve performance in Gumby 2, we removed the delegation of all UI events to the document. This means dynamically generated UI modules need initializing, each UI module has an initalization key that can be passed to the Gumby.initialize method in order to initialize all new UI modules. You can "re-initialize" a single instance of a UI module by triggering the gumby.initialize event on the element, all UI modules that accept attribute parameters will listen for an initialize event so that the attributes can be dynamically updated.

```
  // initialize dynamic tabs
  Gumby.initialize('tabs');
 
  // initialize single skiplink instance
  $('#my-skiplink').trigger('gumby.initialize');
 
  // listen for the tabs onChange event
  $('#my-tabs').on('gumby.onChange', function() {
      console.log('My tabs changed');
  });
 
  // programatically trigger toggle
  $('#my-toggle').trigger('gumby.trigger');
```
